About:

EuIrr is a Euphoria wrapper for the Irrlicht 3D Engine. It is based off of the C port CIrrlicht. The
functions ported in that port have been ported over to Euphoria. What this does is allows you to use
Euphoria with the Irrlicht 3D Engine. Irrlicht is a 3D graphics engine. It can load many different
file formats and has features that are commonly found in commerical 3D Engines. A couple of example
programs are included to help you get going.
